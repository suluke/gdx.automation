/**
 * An extension of {@link InputPlayer} that registers itself at the original
 * {@link Gdx#input} as an {@link InputProcessor} to listen for certain events
 * that can be set programmatially. Those events will then be multiplexed with
 * the recorded input. This enables, for example, to use the
 * {@link MultiplexedInputPlayer} to control a game's main actor in a tutorial
 * while at the same time the user can press a runtime triggerable button to
 * skip it.
 * 
 * This is WIP TODO, so not public api
