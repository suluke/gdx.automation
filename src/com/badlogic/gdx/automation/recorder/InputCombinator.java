 * An extension of {@link InputPlayer} that registers itself at the original

 * that can be set programmatically. Those events will then be combined with the
 * recorded input. This enables, for example, to use the {@link InputCombinator}
 * to control a game's main actor in a tutorial while at the same time the user
 * can press a button to skip it.
 * 
 * This is still WIP TODO, so not public api
